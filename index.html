4.) http://cryptorials.io/category/privacy/  
This is a fantastic resource on learning about all things crypto and privacy. It has a ton of articles explaining a myriad of different technologies and how to use them. What I want to build is something a little more focused that allow developers and lay persons to discover different technologies and get a better over view of this rapidly changing industry.  Its easy to find what you are looking for.
